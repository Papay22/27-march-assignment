    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. In other words, it measures how well the regression line fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = 1 - (SSres / SStot)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where SSres is the sum of squared residuals (the difference between the actual values and predicted values), and SStot is the total sum of squares (the difference between the actual values and the mean value).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the regression line to the data. A value of 0 indicates that none of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s), while a value of 1 indicates that all of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared can be interpreted as the percentage of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s). For example, an R-squared value of 0.8 means that 80% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable(s) in the model.\n",

    "It's important to note that R-squared does not indicate whether a regression model is good or bad on its own. It should be used in conjunction with other measures such as residual plots, hypothesis tests, and cross-validation to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model."

Regular R-squared can increase even if an independent variable has little or no effect on the dependent variable, simply because it adds more variance to the model. Adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, will only increase if an additional independent variable improves the fit of the model beyond what would be expected by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, adjusted R-squared will be lower than regular R-squared if there are many independent variables in the model, because it takes into account the fact that adding more variables can increase the fit of the model by chance alone. Adjusted R-squared is therefore a more conservative measure of goodness-of-fit than regular R-squared, and is often used to compare models with different numbers of independent variables."

    "Lasso regularization is a technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function.
